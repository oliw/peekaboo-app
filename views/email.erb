Dear <%= params[:name] %>,

Thanks for using Peekaboo's BabyConnect analytics service. Our mission is to help you discover the secret patterns lurking beneath your baby's data.

To begin analysing your baby's data we need you to send us your data via the BabyConnect app. It's very simple just follow the simple instruction at http:://peekaboo-lab.heroku-app.com/howto . Once we have received your email with the BabyConnect data, we will inform you when analysis has begun.
