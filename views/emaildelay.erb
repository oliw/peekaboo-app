Dear <%= params[:name] %>,

Thanks for using Peekaboo Lab's Baby Connect analytics service! Our mission is to help you discover patterns and insights in your baby's data so you can make better decisions as a parent.

We've just started, and the response has been overwhelming! This is a good thing, however there might be a bit of a wait. Send us your data and we will get started on your report as soon as we can!

To begin analysing your baby's data we need you to send us your data via the Baby Connect app. It's very simple - just follow the simple instructions at http://www.peekaboo-labs.com/howto . Once we have received your email with the Baby Connect data, we will get to work straight away.

If you are having any difficulties, drop us a line at info@peekaboo-labs.com

Thanks!
Oli on behalf of the Peekaboo Team
